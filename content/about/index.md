## General Info
I like messing around with nearly anything that's tech related, I've done a bunch of things ranging from programming software to hacking hardware, creating 3D models, game development, networking, etc.
I could list all the things I've tried but most were just introductory stuff in order to get the basics.

The things where I think I'm doing my best would be general automation and problem solving since these things can be applied to any kind of software, programming language or whatever else.

## What I use
**Anything that I consider to be good for the job!?** For the moment these are the things I feel most comfortable using:

- [Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) - Because **fuck Windows as a server OS**, and MacOS has no parity (hello `sed` and `grep`) and simply **IS** a dumbed-down, locked OS that is trying to stop you from actually being productive (what is window management? proper side buttons on a mouse? what's that)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - For provisioning servers and configuration management
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Anytime I need to run something quickly and I don't want to install system packages just to run one thing
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - For running things at scale, especially when there are a lot of apps that need to communicate with each other
- [Borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/) - When I need to automate backups, runs `borg` under the hood but it's much easier to manage and has a lot of integrations
- [Healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) - Whenever I need to make sure scheduled jobs run on time
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/),[Grafana](https://grafana.com) - Metrics monitoring stack, paired with [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)
