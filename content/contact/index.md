I'm quite easy to get in contact with given that most of my time is spent interacting with some form of computer.

The easiest way to get in contact with me would probably be via [Discord](https://discord.com/) **@georgegedox**.

I'm open to discussions about almost anything, from projects and programming stuff to movies, music and games.
